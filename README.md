# Old project

I made this project a while ago, and it is pretty bad.  Essentially I thought I found an edge over draft kings in a few rare circumstances.  I didn't want to write a web scrapper to find the prices so I didn't.  Anyway if you manually put in some lines on some parlays you might find an edge.
